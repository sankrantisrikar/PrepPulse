## Expected Interview Questions

Based on the resume and JD above, Interview Buddy should generate questions like:

### Question 1 (Leadership)
"You mentioned mentoring a team of 4 junior engineers at TechCorp. Can you walk me through a specific situation where you had to help a junior engineer overcome a significant technical challenge? What was your approach, and what was the outcome?"

**Resume Citation:** "Mentored team of 4 junior engineers"
**JD Citation:** "Mentor junior engineers through code reviews and pair programming"

### Question 2 (System Design)
"At TechCorp, you architected a microservices infrastructure that reduced deployment time by 75%. Can you describe the architecture you designed, the key technical decisions you made, and any trade-offs you considered?"

**Resume Citation:** "Architected microservices infrastructure using Node.js, Docker, and Kubernetes"
**JD Citation:** "Design and implement scalable backend services using Node.js and microservices architecture"

### Question 3 (Performance Optimization)
"You reduced API response time from 800ms to 200ms through optimization. Tell me about the process you followed to identify the bottlenecks and the specific techniques you used to achieve this improvement."

**Resume Citation:** "Reduced API response time from 800ms to 200ms"
**JD Citation:** "Optimize application performance and database queries for scale"

### Question 4 (Real-time Systems)
"The job requires experience with real-time systems, and you built a WebSocket-based notification system at TechCorp. Can you describe the technical challenges you faced with real-time message delivery and how you achieved 99.9% reliability?"

**Resume Citation:** "Collaborated with product team to define technical requirements"
**JD Citation:** "Collaborate with product managers and designers to define technical requirements"

## Sample Answers (for testing transcription)

### Good Answer (Score: 8/10)
"At TechCorp, I mentored a junior engineer named Sarah who was struggling with implementing a complex caching layer. The situation was that we needed to reduce database load, but she was unfamiliar with Redis. 

My approach was to first pair program with her for a few hours to demonstrate the patterns, then I created a detailed design document outlining the caching strategy. I also set up weekly 1-on-1s where we'd review her code and discuss best practices.

The result was that within three weeks, Sarah successfully implemented the caching layer, which reduced our database queries by 40%. More importantly, she became our team's go-to person for caching questions and even presented her work at our engineering all-hands. This experience taught me the importance of hands-on mentorship combined with documentation."

**Why it scores well:**
- Clear STAR structure (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Specific metrics (40% reduction, 3 weeks)
- Shows impact beyond the immediate task
- Demonstrates leadership and communication skills

### Weak Answer (Score: 4/10)
"Yeah, I've mentored people before. At my last job, I helped junior engineers when they had questions. I would review their code and give them feedback. It usually went pretty well, and they learned a lot from me. I think mentoring is important for team growth."

**Why it scores poorly:**
- No specific example or situation
- Vague and generic statements
- No measurable outcomes
- Lacks structure (no STAR format)
- Doesn't demonstrate depth of experience

## Testing Tips

1. **Start with the good answer** to verify scoring works correctly
2. **Try the weak answer** to see how the system identifies gaps
3. **Test follow-up logic** by giving shallow answers (should trigger depth < 5)
4. **Test topic switching** by giving detailed answers (should trigger depth >= 5)
5. **Test transcription** with different accents and speaking speeds

## Sample Follow-up Questions

If user gives a shallow answer to Question 1, the system should generate follow-ups like:

- "What specific technical challenge was Sarah facing with Redis?"
- "Can you walk me through the actual code patterns you demonstrated?"
- "How did you measure the success of your mentorship?"
- "What would you do differently if you had to mentor Sarah again?"

## Cost Estimate for This Test

Using the sample data above:
- Resume: ~500 words
- Job Description: ~600 words
- 5 questions with 2 follow-ups each = 15 total questions
- Average answer: 100 words = ~30 seconds audio

**Estimated cost:**
- OpenRouter: ~20K tokens = $0.20
- ElevenLabs TTS: ~2K characters = $0.06
- ElevenLabs STT: 7.5 min audio = $0.023
- D-ID: 15 videos = $0.90
- **Total: ~$1.18 per test session**
